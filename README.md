# Simple Wallet Connect

## Project Overview
Simple Wallet Connect is a web application built using Next.js that allows users to connect and interact with various cryptocurrency wallets, primarily focusing on Solana wallet integrations. It provides a seamless interface for users to manage their wallets, make transactions, and engage with decentralized applications (dApps).

## Installation
To set up the Simple Wallet Connect project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/simple-wallet-connect.git

   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   Make sure you have Node.js installed (version 14 or higher is recommended). Run the following command to install all necessary packages:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Usage
After successfully installing the dependencies, you can start the development server. In your terminal, run:
```bash
npm run dev
```
This will start the Next.js application at `http://localhost:3000`. You can view and interact with the application in your web browser.

### Build for Production

```bash
npm run build
```
You can then start the production server by running:
